    Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
    both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
    Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
    an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
    white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
    draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
    No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
    cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
    that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
    Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
    With all the admired beauties of Verona:
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
    And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
    My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    The traces of the smallest spider's web,
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
    Laying PARIS in the tomb
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    Opens the tomb
    Enters the tomb
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
    Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
    What is her burying grave that is her womb,
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
    Enter Citizens, & c
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
    Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
    That the life-weary taker may fall dead
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
    Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
    O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
    Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
    Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
    Put not another sin upon my head,
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
    Stay, fellow; I can read.
    God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
    O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
    God's bread! it makes me mad:
    Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
    Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
    Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
    inch narrow to an ell broad!
    What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
    Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
    Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
    Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
    I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
    To have her match'd: and having now provided
    Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
    Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
    In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
    Doting like me and like me banished,
    They are free men, but I am banished.
    And world's exile is death: then banished,
    Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
    But Romeo may not; he is banished:
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
    Hence from Verona art thou banished:
    But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
    It is supposed, the fair creature died;
    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
    Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
    And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
    As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
    O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
    Go ask his name: if he be married.
    How stands your disposition to be married?
    And with my child my joys are buried.
    Who here hath lain these two days buried.
    Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
    Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
    Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    dares, being dared.
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
    Your high displeasure: all this uttered
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
    Why, then is my pump well flowered.
    As violently as hasty powder fired
    He shall be endured:
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
    Myself condemned and myself excused.
    Life and these lips have long been separated:
    O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
    Enter BALTHASAR, booted
    Tush, thou art deceived:
    To make confession and to be absolved.
    I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
    soon moody to be moved.
    Which modern lamentations might have moved?
    I strike quickly, being moved.
    I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    And all the better is it for the maid:
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
    Noting this penury, to myself I said
    She was too good for me: but, as I said,
    Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
    It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
    Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
    A' was a merry man--took up the child:
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Warm and new kill'd.
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
    Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
    Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
    That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
    But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
    Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
    My child is yet a stranger in the world;
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
    Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
    you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
    for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
    proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
    You are looked for and called for, asked for and
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
    Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    enrich the hand
    Hold thy desperate hand:
    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
    Can I demand.
    my errand;
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
    and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
    This but begins the woe, others must end.
    Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
    Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
    So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
    Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
    The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
    This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
    To-morrow will I send.
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
    We sucking on her natural bosom find,
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    You say you do not know the lady's mind:
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    And soar with them above a common bound.
    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
    To seek him here that means not to be found.
    What hast thou found?
    Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    'Then music with her silver sound
    Then music with her silver sound'--
    for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
    Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
    And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
    Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
    it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
    a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
    A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
    Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
    O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
    For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
    And stole into the covert of the wood:
    O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
    Have at thee, coward!
    Comes forward
    Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
    The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
    I would I were thy bird.
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
    Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
    Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
    No, my good lord.
    My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
    O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    Monday, my lord,
    Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
    Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
    Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
    me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
    'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
    I take thee at thy word:
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
    enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
    Drawing his sword
    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    Who calls so loud?
    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
    Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
    [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
    Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
    Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
    Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
    I do remember well where I should be,
    What must be shall be.
    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    Or never after look me in the face:
    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
    fairer face.
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
    Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    Is partly to behold my lady's face;
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
    Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
    You tallow-face!
    In such a gorgeous palace!
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Together with the terror of the place,--
    Either withdraw unto some private place,
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
    By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
    Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
    Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
    Then dreams, he of another benefice:
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
    If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
    Music plays, and they dance
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
    After the prompter, for our entrance:
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
    And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
    And for that offence
    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
    Immediately we do exile him hence:
    Shalt with him hence.
    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
    And bear this work of heaven with patience:
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
    Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
    Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
    An I might live to see thee married once,
    O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    sharp sauce.
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    Younger than she are happy mothers made.
    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
    For fair without the fair within to hide:
    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    Let two more summers wither in their pride,
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    good quarrel, and the law on my side.
    See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
    To Lammas-tide?
    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
    I do protest, I never injured thee,
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
    And I'll believe thee.
    Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    And for that name which is no part of thee
    I do beseech thee--
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
    What, shall I groan and tell thee?
    There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
    And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
    Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
    Shall I send to thee?
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
    O, what more favour can I do to thee,
    Because it is an enemy to thee;
    protest unto thee--
    No, marry; I fear thee!
    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
    Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    We follow thee.
    For what, I pray thee?
    Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
    Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
    Look, and thou shalt see.
    pray, can you read any thing you see?
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    O me, O me! My child, my only life,
    A challenge, on my life.
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
    That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
    There stays a husband to make you a wife:
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
    Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
    Happily met, my lady and my wife!
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
    What further woe conspires against mine age?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
    Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
    Making them women of good carriage:
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    All this I know; and to the marriage
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!

    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
    A gentleman of noble parentage,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
    To bid me trudge:
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    The letter was not nice but full of charge
    Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
    Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
    Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
    Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
    Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
    Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
    Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
    This is she--
    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
    Away with the joint-stools, remove the
    'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
    button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
    shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
    love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
    ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
    O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
    Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
    Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
    Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
    there rust, and let me die.
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.
    My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
    Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.
    And these, who often drown'd could never die,
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
    Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
    That dreamers often lie.
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    You lie.
    No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    Or, if I live, is it not very like,
    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
    is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
    I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
    This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
    What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
    Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
    O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
    that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
    The fee-simple! O simple!
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
    One of our order, to associate me,
    I'll fa you; do you note me?
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
    So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
    Do not deny to him that you love me.
    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
    What wouldst thou have with me?
    You Capulet; shall go along with me:
    Or manage it to part these men with me.
    Come, go with me.
    But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    Up, sir, go with me;
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    fingers goes not with me.
    What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
    By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
    I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
    To County Paris: then comes she to me,
    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
    But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
    And his to me:
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    to comfort me.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
    Ay me!
    I drew to part them: in the instant came
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
    Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
    For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
    Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    And this shall free thee from this present shame;
    By a name
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
    As if that name,
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
    What a pestilent knave is this same!
    Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
    person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    O woful time!
    And he shall signify from time to time
    Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
    We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
    You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
    And joy comes well in such a needy time:
    What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
    By and by, I come:--
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
    For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
    assembly: whither should they come?
    ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    And all combined, save what thou must combine
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
    Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
    God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
    nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
    For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
    The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
    That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
    At the hour of nine.
    But new struck nine.
    Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
    Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
    of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
    Which on more view, of many mine being one
    Till holy church incorporate two in one.
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
    Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
    Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
    In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
    By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
    Go, be gone.
    Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
    Romeo, away, be gone!
    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
    No matter: get thee gone,
    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
    For who is living, if those two are gone?
    Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
    Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
    [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    Now must I to the monument alone;
    That most are busied when they're most alone,
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
    To such a greeting: villain am I none;
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
    A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
    Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
    Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
    For never was a story of more woe
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
    Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
    Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
    though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
    should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
    And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
    Which she hath praised him with above compare
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
    I would not for the world they saw thee here.
    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
    And but thou love me, let them find me here:
    sent to find those persons whose names are here
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
    Madam, I am here.
    Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
    Nurse! What should she do here?
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Every good hap to you that chances here:
    Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
    What noise is here?
    'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
    Can I go forward when my heart is here?
    Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
    I departed not and left him there.
    How long hath he been there?
    Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
    Stop there, stop there.
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
    What's there?
    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
    To meet her new-beloved any where:
    Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
    O, that she knew she were!
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
    By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
    Is too much for a score,
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    But saying o'er what I have said before:
    Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
    No, no: but all this did I know before.
    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
    But I can give thee more:
    To call hers exquisite, in question more:
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
    That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
    too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Then I will give you the serving-creature.
    thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
    Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
    Some misadventure.
    For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
    To know our further pleasure in this case,
    O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
    Why 'Heart's ease?'
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
    these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
    I would adventure for such merchandise.
    Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    Bid her devise
    But love thee better than thou canst devise,
    Do thou but call my resolution wise,
    He is wise;
    A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
    not there for the goose.
    was I with you there for the goose?
    And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
    What's in a name? that which we call a rose
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
    Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

    The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
    What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
    Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

    Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
    Some comfort, nurse.
    An honour! were not I thine only nurse,

    But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
    A precious ring, a ring that I must use
    very first house, of the first and second cause:
    My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
    What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
    Her mother is the lady of the house,
    Whose house?
    To supper; to our house.
    This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    O any thing, of nothing first create!
    Peter, stay at the gate.
    Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
    Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    Proud can I never be of what I hate;
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    My life were better ended by their hate,
    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    My only love sprung from my only hate!
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
    Afore me! it is so very very late,
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
    Benedicite!
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    A villain that is hither come in spite,
    For it was bad enough before their spite.
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
    What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
    Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
    I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
    Make haste, make haste.
    O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
    Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
    Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
    This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
    For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.

    This is that banish'd haughty Montague,

    And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    his tongue,
    Blister'd be thy tongue
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
    In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
    Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
    O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    Is to himself--I will not say how true--
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
    Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
    I have.
    Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
    To lay one in, another out to have.
    Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
    Not in a grave,
    To press before thy father to a grave?
    To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    I would the fool were married to her grave!
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
    court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
    The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
    thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
    But to the earth some special good doth give,
    I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
    Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
    What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
    To make die with a restorative.

    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
    Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
    Of love?
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
    A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
    In love?
    Out of her favour, where I am in love.
    If my heart's dear love--
    Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
    Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
    To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
    One that you love.
    Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    Here's to my love!
    It is my lady, O, it is my love!
    Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
    And bad'st me bury love.
    I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
    Black and portentous must this humour prove,
    For this alliance may so happy prove,
    I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
    Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    When the devout religion of mine eye
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    Herself poised with herself in either eye:
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
    lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
    Who is already sick and pale with grief,
    Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    Stabs herself
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
    Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
    Take all myself.
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    For I come hither arm'd against myself:
    upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
    done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
    rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
    Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
    letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
    It is an honour that I dream not of.
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
    Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
    How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    Out on her, hilding!
    because musicians have no gold for sounding:
    Singing
    For this night's watching.
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
    Thou talk'st of nothing.
    Is he gone, and hath nothing?
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
    At the prefixed hour of her waking,
    Knocking
    Knocking
    Knocking
    to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
    wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
    sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
    Romeo is coming.
    Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
    Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Retiring
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
    The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    writ, and can never find what names the writing
    Could you not take some occasion without giving?
    Drawing
    She's not well married that lives married long;
    Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
    And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
    Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
    Soft! I will go along;
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    Is the day so young?
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
    Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
    Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
    Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
    In all her best array bear her to church:
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
    O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
    And then I ran away to call the watch.
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
    Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
    Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
    What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
    Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
    Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    Good night, good night! parting is such
    down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
    By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
    Dost thou not laugh?
    Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
    Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
    Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
    Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
    In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
    I have my wish.
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
    Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
    Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Why I descend into this bed of death,
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    And fearfully did menace me with death,
    And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
    Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
    Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
    Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
    Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
    Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    This is thy sheath;
    And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
    I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
    How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
    Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
    grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
    if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
    yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with

    sick health!
    Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
    to in a month.
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Or else beshrew them both.
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
    Unfold the imagined happiness that both
    Of honourable reckoning are you both;
    [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    Ay, forsooth.
    Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    How shall that faith return again to earth,
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
    Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    And so did I.
    Sweet, so would I:
    And hither shall he come: and he and I
    courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    A visor for a visor! what care I
    And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
    quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
    Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
    I am not I, if there be such an I;
    me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
    Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
    But Montague is bound as well as I,
    Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
    arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
    Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
    Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
    A lightning before death: O, how may I
    And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
    hai!
    Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
    May not one speak?
    Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
    But send him back.
    Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
    A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
    My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
    Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
    The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
    Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
    That I might touch that cheek!
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
    Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
    the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    to think!--
    O, teach me how I should forget to think.
    Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
    There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
    You kiss by the book.
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
    Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
    Why, may one ask?
    Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
    Were in a mask?
    And we mean well in going to this mask;
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Of one I danced withal.
    How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
    Come, vial.
    Turn from their office to black funeral;
    for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
    All things that we ordained festival,
    As is the night before some festival
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
    I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
    And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
    eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
    I will give you the minstrel.
    I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
    So stumblest on my counsel?
    A sail, a sail!
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
    Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
    Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    O noble prince, I can discover all
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    Do not swear at all;
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
    Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
    Go to; I say you shall.
    He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
    to the wall.
    to the wall.
    Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
    And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
    O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
    Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
    Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
    I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
    Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    Unto my cell.
    Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
    the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
    Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
    For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    Madam, I am not well.
    I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
    I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
    O, she knew well
    You say well.
    So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
    Farewell!
    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
    Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
    Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
    Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
    The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
    Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
    Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
    Bear hence this body and attend our will:
    What is your will?
    Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
    Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
    Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
    Put this in any liquid thing you will,
    But let them measure us by what they will;
    I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
    Peace, you mumbling fool!
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    O, I am fortune's fool!
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
    If thou be merciful,
    What said my man, when my betossed soul
    O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    And then my husband--God be with his soul!
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
    So thrive my soul--
    And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
    Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
    his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
    Madam!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
    I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    What villain madam?
    [Within] Madam!
    [Within] Madam!
    I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Is death to any he that utters them.
    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
    To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
    Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
    An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
    I'll not endure him.
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    I will confess to you that I love him.
    As living here and you no use of him.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
    I neither know it nor can learn of him.
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
    We took this mattock and this spade from him,
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    And by and by my master drew on him;
    Our whole city is much bound to him.
    To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
    I conjure only but to raise up him.
    This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
    And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
    Kisses him
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
    you have found him than he was when you sought him:
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    And that my master slew him.
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
    Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
    What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
    And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    was hurt under your arm.
    Thy lips are warm.
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
    Not so big as a round little worm
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
    Strike, drum.
    O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
    Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
    Romeo can,
    Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
    Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    A man, young lady! lady, such a man
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
    Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
    Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
    Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    We still have known thee for a holy man.
    Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
    An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
    What say you? can you love the gentleman?
    The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    He bears him like a portly gentleman;
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
    kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
    God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
    Antony, and Potpan!
    Is it good den?
    O, God ye god-den.
    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
    Alone, in company, still my care hath been
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
    Many a morning hath he there been seen,
    Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
    Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    She's not fourteen.
    And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
    Welcome, then.
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
    That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
    Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
    You will not, then?
    I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
    me like men:
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    We talk here in the public haunt of men:
    Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
    No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
    Amen!
    God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    With instruments upon them, fit to open
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
    This same should be the voice of Friar John.
    Enter FRIAR JOHN
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
    Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    Give me a case to put my visage in:
    And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
    That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
    But to be frank, and give it thee again.
    I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.
    Noise again
    And yet I would it were to give again.
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
    Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
    How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
    Give me my sin again.
    What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
    Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
    I could not send it,--here it is again,--
    And then down falls again.
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
    O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
    No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    But to his foe supposed he must complain,
    Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    O, I am slain!
    Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
    Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
    Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
    Depart again: here, here will I remain
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Go, then; for 'tis in vain
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
    For your broken shin.
    Music within
    Noise within
    Knocking within
    Where is my mother! why, she is within;
    Nurse calls within
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
    Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
    Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    O cousin, cousin!
    Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
    Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
    Good-morrow, cousin.
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin
    But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
    will give me occasion.
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    We shall be short in our provision:
    The hateful mansion.
    Why, such is love's transgression.
    At thy good heart's oppression.
    O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
    That were some spite: my invocation
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
    So fearful were they of infection.
    Of disobedient opposition
    A most courteous exposition.
    The most you sought was her promotion;
    God shield I should disturb devotion!
    Which craves as desperate an execution.
    Anon!
    Anon!
    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
    Anon, anon!
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
    dial is now upon the prick of noon.
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
    I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
    Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    So early walking did I see your son:
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
    I speak no treason.
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
    O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
    Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
    It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
    Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
    Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
    In half an hour she promised to return.
    Ready to go, but never to return.
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
    How! turn thy back and run?
    Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
    One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
    It may be so, for it is not mine own.
    With blood removed but little from her own?
    I, measuring his affections by my own,
    To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    He goeth down
    Throws them down
    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
    To see thy son and heir more early down.
    I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
    With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
    That while Verona by that name is known,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    I would not for the wealth of all the town
    am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
    Why should you fall into so deep an O?
    Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
    In what I further shall intend to do,
    O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
    Come, sir, your passado.
    Romeo!
    Romeo.

    may find the young Romeo?
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
    That same villain, Romeo.
    'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
    Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
    Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
    Shame come to Romeo!
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    But by and by comes back to Romeo,
    Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
    The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

    I wake before the time that Romeo
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?

    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
    The people in the street cry Romeo,
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
    Come, shall we go?
    Go, you cot-quean, go,
    I have more care to stay than will to go:
    But 'tis no wit to go.
    Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
    Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
    I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
    His son was but a ward two years ago.
    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
    A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
    Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
    Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
    But sadly tell me who.
    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

    Call, good Mercutio.
    Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
    Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    No.
    No.
    wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
    Groan! why, no.
    Nay, I'll conjure too.
    And from my soul too;
    A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
    Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
    And I for winking at your discords too
    O, now I would they had changed voices too!
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
    Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
    But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
    These times of woe afford no time to woo.
    Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
    O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
    How canst thou try them so?
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
    My father Capulet will have it so;
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    The other did not so.
    Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
    Nay, that's not so.
    Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
    kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
    One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
    blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
    What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
    Go to, go to;
    Am I the master here, or you? go to.
    And what to?
    but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
    We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
    No, coz, I rather weep.
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    Help, help! Call help.
    If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
    Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
    heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    Up.
    Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
    Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
    Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
    More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
    And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
    Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
    [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
    What misadventure is so early up,
    Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
    Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
    That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
    O God's lady dear!
    My dear?
    Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    Here's goodly gear!
    For so he said he would: I hear him near.
    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
    Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
    I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
    Even or odd, of all days in the year,
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    Too familiar
    What if it be a poison, which the friar
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
    O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
    is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

    Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
    sought for, in the great chamber.
    Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
    Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
    Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
    Doth make against me of this direful murder;
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
    Laying down her dagger
    Snatching ROMEO's dagger
    Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
    And that we have a curse in having her:
    Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
    O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
    see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
    God in heaven bless her!
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
    shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    Farewell, dear father!
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    Come you to make confession to this father?
    Good morrow, father.
    Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
    I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    to dinner, thither.
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
    Whither?
    the--No; I know it begins with some other
    What is her mother?
    Your mother.
    Where is your mother?'
    warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
    Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
    In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    mourners, and stay dinner.

    To Servant, giving a paper
    Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,

    What is the matter?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    No better.
    rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
    Any man that can write may answer a letter.
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
    why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
    I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    To merit bliss by making me despair:
    They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

    O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
    Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
    The heads of the maids?
    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And see how he will take it at your hands.
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
    Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
    These violent delights have violent ends
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    Both by myself and many other friends:
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Cold death aside, and with the other sends
    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    Ay, ay, the cords.
    Enter Nurse, with cords
    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
    Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
    This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Beats down their swords
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
    Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    Advances
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
    Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
    Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
    Dies
    Dies
    Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
    That's by me wounded: both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies:
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
    And what obscured in this fair volume lies
    So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Till we can clear these ambiguities,
    Examine other beauties.
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    JULIET wakes
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
    The Page whistles
    Ay, a thousand times.
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    O God, she comes!
    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
    Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    bones, their bones!
    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
    More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
    And then will I be general of your woes,
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    Retires
    Retires
    Retires
    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    And soundly too: your houses!
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    two of the house of the Montagues.
    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
    Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
    I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
    I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
    Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
    Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
    Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
    How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Find written in the margent of his eyes.
    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    But every man betake him to his legs.
    Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
    Sings
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
    Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
    I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
    And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
    To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
    More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
    On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
    Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
    Faith, here it is.
    Find them out whose names are written here! It is
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
    how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
    written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
    own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
    Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
    Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
    Send for the county; go tell him of this:
    Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
    Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
    Never was seen so black a day as this:
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
    But, soft! what day is this?
    What's this? what's this?
    [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
    Forgetting any other home but this.
    How well my comfort is revived by this!
    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
    Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
    O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    If, rather than to marry County Paris,
    She speaks:
    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
    No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
    Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    Shall have the chinks.
    Drinks
    their books,
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
    man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
    Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
    face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    How now! who calls?
    Falls
    They fight; TYBALT falls
    There is no world without Verona walls,
    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
    Driving back shadows over louring hills:
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Part, fools!
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
    Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
    There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
    True, I talk of dreams,
    constrains a man to bow in the hams.
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Have you importuned him by any means?
    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
    Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
    When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
    Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
    As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
    She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
    Undraws the curtains
    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
    Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    I do defy thy conjurations,
    Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    For I have need of many orisons
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
    O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
    And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Like softest music to attending ears!
    O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
    What fear is this which startles in our ears?
    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
    Environed with all these hideous fears?
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
    To stop the inundation of her tears;
    Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
    And since that time it is eleven years;
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    By'r lady, thirty years.
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
    how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
    can lick their fingers.
    Enter MONTAGUE and others
    Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
    Enter TYBALT and others
    No, for then we should be colliers.
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
    'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
    My master's.
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
    TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
    The lady stirs.
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
    That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
    Well, what was yours?
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    By having him, making yourself no less.
    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
    singleness.
    In this so sudden business.
    To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    With speedy help doth lend redress.'
    And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
    Feeling so the loss,
    Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
    a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
    the streets,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
    Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
    By my head, here come the Capulets.
    Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
    At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
    It strains me past the compass of my wits:
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
    Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
    Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
    My poverty, but not my will, consents.
    If I did stay to look on his intents.
    And madly play with my forefather's joints?
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
    I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
    An you re us and fa us, you note us.
    What will you give us?
    This doth not so, for she divideth us:
    Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
    What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
    Can heaven be so envious?
    Be not her maid, since she is envious;
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    That unsubstantial death is amorous,
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous

    Draws
    thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    O honey nurse, what news?
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
    O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    A fortnight and odd days.
    For you and I are past our dancing days:
    For in a minute there are many days:
    Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
    Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
    Juliet, the county stays.
    Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
    Will you tell me that?
    This shall determine that.
    What says he of our marriage? what of that?
    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
    Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
    Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
    Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
    Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
    So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
    The tears have got small victory by that;
    What?
    The what?
    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
    Good heart, at what?
    Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
    This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
    Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
    I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    It is my will, the which if thou respect,
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
    Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
    What is it else? a madness most discreet,
    Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
    A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
    By any other name would smell as sweet;
    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
    Come, go, good Juliet,
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

    Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
    Without a sudden calm, will overset
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
    Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
    Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
    The county will be here with music straight,
    And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
    Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
    hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
    And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
    A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
    I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Good night.
    Good night:
    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
    A thousand times good night!
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    That plats the manes of horses in the night,
    That he should hither come as this dire night,
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And makes himself an artificial night:
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    And never from this palace of dim night
    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    'Tis now near night.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
    To be consorted with the humorous night:
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
    But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    fairly last night.
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    And in this state she gallops night by night
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
    O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
    Of yonder knight?
    Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
    And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Came he not home to-night?
    What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
    I dream'd a dream to-night.
    'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Right.
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
    O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    It rains downright.
    All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
    I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
    And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
    Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
    worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.
    Of dear import, and the neglecting it
    They must take it in sense that feel it.
    That copest with death himself to scape from it:
    He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
    Give me the letter; I will look on it.
    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
    to hear it.
    Let me stand here till thou remember it.
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
    Romeo will answer it.
    Young Romeo is it?
    Who is it?
    And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
    Thou hast most kindly hit it.
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
    I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
    to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
    Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    So many guests invite as here are writ.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
    Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
    With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;

    Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
    Go with me to the vault.

    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,

    true descent;
    Is very good meat in lent
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    Examine every married lineament,
    For though fond nature bids us an lament,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
    Here in my house do him disparagement:
    O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
    Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
    Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
    What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
    Each part, deprived of supple government,
    To this same place, to this same monument.
    With open outcry toward our monument.

    Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
    And see how one another lends content
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.

    Are made already mothers: by my count,
    You are too hot.
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    For it excels your first: or if it did not,
    I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
    Fear me not.
    Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
    By my heel, I care not.
    Nay, good goose, bite not.
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
    as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
    Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
    For here we need it not.
    Uneven is the course, I like it not.
    In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
    We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
    'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
    I know not.
    That I yet know not?
    Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
    Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
    now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
    Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
    Speakest thou from thy heart?
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
    God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    My will to her consent is but a part;
    Came more and more and fought on part and part,
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    Till the prince came, who parted either part.
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
    Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
    O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
    On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
    Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
    Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
    At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
    My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
    I am hurt.
    What, art thou hurt?
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
    The unreasonable fury of a beast:
    And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
    This night you shall behold him at our feast;
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    I am the greatest, able to do least,
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
    Of a despised life closed in my breast
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
    Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?
    Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
    Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
    I thought all for the best.
    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
    And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
    I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
    Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    That calls our person from our morning's rest?
    The County Paris hath set up his rest,
    I'll to my rest.
    Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
    It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
    As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
    they list.
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
    Spare not for the cost.
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
    Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
    Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
    the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
    There's no trust,
    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
    Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
    Out--
    ears ere it be out.
    Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    Going to find a bare-foot brother out
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out

    Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
    To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.

    Tush, I will stir about,
    Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about

    And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
    That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

    That's a certain text.

    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

    Out upon you! what a man are you!
    and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
    Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
    And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
    Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
    But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
    And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
    To answer that, I should confess to you.
    Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
    I am for you.

    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
    Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
    And presently took post to tell it you:
    I will follow you.
    Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
    fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,

    Unto the rigour of severest law.
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
    Should in the furthest east begin to draw
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

    JULIET appears above at a window
    Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
    By holy marriage: when and where and how
    Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    something; make it a word and a blow.
    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
    Am I like such a fellow?
    Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
    Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
    Now, fellow,
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
    No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
    I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
    She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
    A rhyme I learn'd even now
    'An if a man did need a poison now,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
    My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
    What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
    And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
    Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
    [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
    We would as willingly give cure as know.
    For even the day before, she broke her brow:
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow

    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
    My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
    Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
    At what o'clock to-morrow
    To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
    I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    sweet sorrow,
    Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
    Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
    We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
    As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
    ay?
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
    And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
    The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
    O lamentable day!
    O lamentable day!
    Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
    O woful day, O woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day,
    Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
    Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
    Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
    How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
    Look, look! O heavy day!
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
    O son! the night before thy wedding-day
    O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
    Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
    I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    I mean, sir, in delay
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
    You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
    Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
    I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
    Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
    Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
    Make haste, I say.

    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    Faith, I know not what to say.
    Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
    Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
    I dare no longer stay.
    Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
    Why dost thou stay?

    O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
    For this time, all the rest depart away:

    Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
    What shall I swear by?
    Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
    Ay, boy, ready.
    Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
    County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
    'lady, lady, lady.'
    I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
    Commend me to thy lady.
    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
    Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
    And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
    I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:

    You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they

    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
    This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My

    Is my dear son with such sour company:
    I promise you, but for your company,
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
    Remembering how I love thy company.

    But, O, it presses to my memory,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
    Rest you merry!
    Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
    Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
    past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
    such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
    be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
    Meaning, to court'sy.
    May be put from her by society:
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
    But Romeo may not: more validity,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.
    And I am proof against their enmity.
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Away to heaven, respective lenity,
    Two households, both alike in dignity,
    To murder, murder our solemnity?
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    I will omit no opportunity
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
    For beauty starved with her severity
    The date is out of such prolixity:
    Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
    This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
    I think it best you married with the county.
    On Thursday next be married to this county.
    To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
    His son is thirty.
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
    Farewell, my coz.
